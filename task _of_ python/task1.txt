Ques: About python and python history?
Ans:Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
    Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
    Python has since become one of the most popular languages in the world,
     widely used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

Key Features
Readability: Clear, easy-to-understand syntax.
Interpreted: Executes code line-by-line.
Dynamically Typed: Types determined at runtime.
High-Level: Abstracts complex system details.
Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for various applications.


Ques: 5 python commands?
Ans: 1: print
     2: type
     3: range
     4: input 
     5: len 


Ques: Define variables?
Ans: In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages,
     such as Java, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
     For examaple: the following code creates a variable called name and assigns it the value "Alice":


Ques:What are the operators and types of operations?
Ans: 1. Arithmetic Operators
     These operators perform mathematical operations:

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder)
** : Exponentiation (power)
// : Floor Division


2. Comparison Operators
These operators compare two values and return a boolean result:

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to


3. Logical Operators
These operators perform logical operations:

and : Logical AND
or : Logical OR
not : Logical NOT


4. Bitwise Operators
These operators perform bit-level operations:

& : Bitwise AND
| : Bitwise OR
^ : Bitwise XOR
~ : Bitwise NOT
<< : Left Shift
>> : Right Shift


5. Assignment Operators
These operators assign values to variables and can perform operations as part of the assignment:

= : Assignment
+= : Add and assign
-= : Subtract and assign
*= : Multiply and assign
/= : Divide and assign
%= : Modulus and assign
**= : Exponentiation and assign
//= : Floor division and assign
&= : Bitwise AND and assign
|= : Bitwise OR and assign
^= : Bitwise XOR and assign
<<= : Left shift and assign
>>= : Right shift and assign


6. Identity Operators
These operators compare the memory locations of two objects:

is : Evaluates to True if the variables on either side refer to the same object
is not : Evaluates to True if the variables on either side do not refer to the same object
7. Membership Operators


These operators test for membership in a sequence (like strings, lists, or tuples):

in : Evaluates to True if the value is found in the sequence
not in : Evaluates to True if the value is not found in the sequence


8. Special Operators
= : Assignment
lambda : Used to create anonymous functions
